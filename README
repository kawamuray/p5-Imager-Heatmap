Imager-Heatmap version 0.03
===========================

Imager::Heatmap - Perl extension for drawing Heatmap using Imager

SYNOPSIS

    use Imager::Heatmap;
    my $hmap = Imager::Heatmap->new(
        xsize  => 640,        # Image width
        ysize  => 480,        # Image height
        xsigma => 10,         # Sigma value of X-direction.
        ysigma => 10,         # Sigma value of Y-direction.
    );

    # Add point datas to construct density matrix
    $hmap->insert_datas(@piont_datas); # @point_datas should be: ( [ x1, y1, weight1 ], [ x2, y2, weight2 ] ... )

    $hmap->insert_datas(...); # You can call multiple times to add large data that cannot process at a time.

    # After adding datas, you could get heatmap as Imager instance.
    my $img = $hmap->draw;

DESCRIPTION

    Imager::Heatmap is a module to draw heatmap using Imager.

    This module calculates probability density matrix from input data and
    map a color for each pixels to represent density of input data.

INSTALLATION
